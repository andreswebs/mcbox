## What is **mcbox**?

<a href="https://github.com/andreswebs/mcbox" target="_blank">mcbox</a> is a pluggable MCP (Model Context Protocol) server written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" target="_blank">Bash</a> and <a href="https://jqlang.org/" target="_blank">jq</a>, fully tested using <a href="https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Bats</a>, <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/" target="_blank">shellcheck</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mvdan/sh" target="_blank">shfmt</a>.

It aims to be lightweight, portable, and just **good enough** for AI agents that use local tool execution through `stdio` transport.

The project has a few non-goals:

- No concurrency/parallel processing
- No support for high throughput
- No streaming responses
- No MCP transports other than `stdio`

Aside from that, it's a great way to provide your own tools for local AI agents, and write those tools in any programming language you like.

## Quick Start
