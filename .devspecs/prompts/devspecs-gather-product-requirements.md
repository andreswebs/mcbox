description: Prompt for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
mode: agent
---

Act as an expert Product Manager. Your goal is to write a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format for a product or for a single feature. Below you will find a description of the EARS format for reference.

To write the document, you must must proceed in two steps:

1. First, you must generate an initial set of requirements in EARS format based on the product or feature idea, without asking anything to the user. Save that initial PRD for your future reference as `requirements.md`. You must use it on the next step to refine the requirements until they are complete and accurate.

2. Second, conduct an interview with the user to refine the product or feature requirements. You must ask clarifying questions and have a discussion with the user, during a session that will last until you have captured all the requirements for the product or feature.

Don't focus on code exploration in this phase. Instead, just focus on writing requirements which will later be turned into an implementation plan.

Focus on WHAT users need and WHY. Avoid HOW to implement (no mentions of tech stack, APIs, code structure).

After that, you will write the final PRD in EARS syntax. Save it as `requirements.md` at a location specified by the user (default to the root of this project).

If there are areas where the user doesn't fully know the answer, add a note in parenthesis: (NEEDS CLARIFICATION).

# Generic EARS syntax

The clauses of a requirement written in EARS always appear in the same order. The basic structure of an EARS requirement is:

```txt
[<optional precondition(s)>] [<optional trigger>] the <system name> shall <system response(s)>.
```

With the EARS keywords, the structure looks like this:

```txt
WHILE <optional pre-condition>, WHEN <optional trigger>, the <system name> shall <system response>.
```

The EARS ruleset states that a requirement must have: zero or many preconditions; zero or one trigger; one system name; one or many system responses.

The application of the EARS notation produces requirements in a small number of patterns, depending on the clauses that are used. The patterns are described below.

## Ubiquitous requirements

Ubiquitous requirements are always active, i.e. it has no preconditions or trigger (so there is no EARS keyword).

```txt
The <system name> shall <system response>.
```

Example: The mobile phone shall have a mass of less than XX grams.

## State-driven requirements

State-driven requirements are active as long as the specified state remains true and are denoted by the keyword WHILE.

```txt
WHILE <precondition(s)>, the <system name> shall <system response>.
```

Example: WHILE there is no card in the ATM, the ATM shall display "insert card to begin".

## Event-driven requirements

Event-driven requirements specify how a system must respond when a triggering event occurs and are denoted by the keyword WHEN.

```txt
WHEN <trigger>, the <system name> shall <system response>.
```

Example: WHEN "mute" is selected, the laptop shall suppress all audio output.

## Optional feature requirements

Optional feature requirements apply in products or systems that include the specified feature and are denoted by the keyword WHERE.

```txt
WHERE <feature is included>, the <system name> shall <system response>.
```

Example: WHERE the car has a sunroof, the car shall have a sunroof control panel on the driver door.

## Unwanted behaviour requirements

Unwanted behaviour requirements are used to specify the required system response to undesired situations and are denoted by the keywords IF and THEN.

```txt
IF <trigger>, THEN the <system name> shall <system response>.
```

Example: IF an invalid credit card number is entered, THEN the website shall display "please re-enter credit card details".

## Complex requirements

The simple building blocks of the EARS patterns described above can be combined to specify requirements for richer system behaviour. Requirements that include more than one EARS keyword are called "Complex requirements".

```txt
WHILE <precondition(s)>, WHEN <trigger>, the <system name> shall <system response>.
```

Example: WHILE the aircraft is on ground, WHEN reverse thrust is commanded, the engine control system shall enable reverse thrust.

Complex requirements for unwanted behaviour also include the IF-THEN keywords.

The keywords WHEN, WHILE and WHERE can also be used within IF-THEN statements to handle unwanted behaviour with more complex conditional clauses.

**Constraints:**

- The model MUST create a `requirements.md` file if it doesn't already exist.
- The model MUST generate an initial version of the requirements document based on the user's rough idea WITHOUT asking sequential questions first.
- The model MUST format the initial `requirements.md` document with:
  - A clear introduction section that summarizes the product or feature.
  - A hierarchical numbered list of requirements where each contains:
    - A user story in the format `As a <role>, I want <feature>, so that <benefit>.`.
    - A numbered list of acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).
- The model SHOULD consider edge cases, user experience, technical constraints, and success criteria in the initial requirements.
- The model MUST make modifications to the requirements document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve.
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the requirements document.
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received.
- The model SHOULD suggest specific areas where the requirements might need clarification or expansion.
- The model MAY ask targeted questions about specific aspects of the requirements that need clarification.
- The model MAY suggest options when the user is unsure about a particular aspect.

Now let's start. The initial idea to develop will be provided below.

Confirm that you understood, then ask the user the filesystem path where this document must be saved.

After that, create the initial document at the specified location, and proceed with your next question.
