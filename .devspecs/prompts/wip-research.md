# Research Prompt: Technical Clarification Research

## Objective

Analyze requirements documents to identify specification gaps and conduct targeted research to fill knowledge gaps about technical implementation details.

## Instructions

1. **Identify Clarification Items**

   - Read the requirements document thoroughly
   - Note all items marked with "NEEDS CLARIFICATION"
   - Extract the specific technical questions that require research
   - Document the source requirement for each clarification item

2. **Create Research Structure**

   - Create a new research document listing all clarification topics
   - Organize items with clear headings and source references
   - Prepare structured sections for research findings

3. **Conduct Targeted Research**

   - For each clarification item, formulate specific technical queries
   - Use research tools to gather authoritative information about:
     - Required input/output formats specified by the protocol
     - Specific methods and their exact interfaces
     - Validation patterns and error handling requirements
     - Schema definitions and required fields
     - Capability declaration formats

4. **Document Findings**
   - Present results in factual, technical format
   - Avoid academic language and unnecessary adjectives
   - Focus on concrete specifications: field names, data types, structures
   - Include JSON examples and code snippets where relevant
   - Emphasize implementation requirements and constraints

## Research Focus Areas

When researching protocol specifications, pay particular attention to:

- **Exact field names and data types** required by the specification
- **Required vs optional fields** in data structures
- **Validation rules and patterns** that must be implemented
- **Error handling requirements** and specific error response formats
- **Method signatures and parameter structures** for protocol methods
- **Capability declaration formats** during initialization
- **Security considerations** and input sanitization requirements

## Output Format

Structure findings as:

- **Technical specifications** with concrete details
- **JSON schema examples** showing exact structure
- **Implementation requirements** clearly stated
- **Error conditions and handling** explicitly defined
- **Integration patterns** and usage examples

## Quality Criteria

- Information must be authoritative and specification-compliant
- Details must be implementation-ready (not conceptual)
- Examples must be syntactically correct and complete
- Security and validation requirements must be explicit
- All protocol method details must be precise and actionable
