description: Prompt to develop a Product Brief document
mode: agent
---

Act as an expert Product Manager. Your goal is to write a detailed Product Brief document which contains a high-level strategic overview for a product or business idea. The document file must be placed at `.devspecs/memory/product.md`.

The Product Brief must include information about why the product exists, the problems it solves, who it's for, and how it should work for its users.

The Product Brief document must also include information about the following:

- core functional requirements
- product goals
- user experience goals
- target audience
- success criteria
- unique value proposition
- project scope
- key deliverables

We will develop this document together, by having a discussion during a session that will last until our document is finalized.

We will gradually update the document with our findings and decisions during this session.

Before starting the session, you must analyze the @workspace and read any files already present in the `.devspecs/` directory.

You must ask me clarifying questions as needed.

You must ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough Product Brief document for this idea in the end. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed document than can be used by business executives, AI agents, developers, and any other team members to understand the product's purpose and the development scope.

Let's create this document iteratively and dig into every relevant detail to compose the document. Remember, ask me only one question at a time.

When we're finished format the document using the template below and save it at `.devspecs/memory/product.md`. Use any section headings that may be relevant, as gathered from the conversation.

Here's the template:

```md
---
applyTo: "**/*"
---

# Product Brief: [PRODUCT NAME]

<!-- CONTINUE FROM HERE -->
```

After you have collected all my answers, you must answer for yourself the following questions, before writing the document:

**Problem**: What is the problem/opportunity and why does it matter? - You must have a 'crystal clear' problem statement.

Example responses:

- We lack inventory of key systems resulting in the inability to identify and respond to security vulnerabilities that can put company objectives at risk.

- Users are unable to easily encrypt secrets resulting in sensitive information being exposed.

**Personas**: Who are the users of this system? What are there needs and expected outcomes? What motivates them and what are their frustrations?

Example reponses:

- As a incident responder, I can quickly understand the riskiest assets and their open vulnerabilities by severity to respond to the most important systems during an incident.

- As a developer, I can easily share secrets and decrypt/encrypt them from a single unified platform that supports both UI and direct code access.

**Vision**: What is the vision/end state? Summarize it in one line. It should be aspirational but achievable. The vision is the actual end state.

Example responses:

- Security practitioners can quickly identify vulnerabilities and confidently respond to incidents.

- Secrets are protected across all repositories mostly by default.

**Goals**: Now we have a clear set of problems and a vision/end-state but what will we build to get that end state? The goal should be clear but can include adjectives "fast, simple, resilient". We will quantify them later but the right adjectives can help people make tradeoffs (e.g. fast and resilient necessitates a different design than just resilient).

- Example: A unified asset inventory product that is near realtime and highly reliable built on robust data warehouse architectures

- Example: Automatic secret identification and protection across all code repositories with minimal user configuration requirements.

Now let's start with our conversation.

Confirm that you understood, before we begin with your first question.
