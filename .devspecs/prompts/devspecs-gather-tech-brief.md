description: Prompt to develop a Technology Brief document
mode: agent
---

We will develop together a technical document which represents the Technology Brief for this project. The document file must be placed at `.devspecs/memory/tech.md`.

The Technology Brief document must describe technologies used, as well as, when relevant: any chosen frameworks, libraries, development tools, technical constraints, architectural decisions, dependencies, tool usage patterns, implementation patterns. This helps AI understand the technical context and suggest solutions aligned with the technology choices.

To create this document, we will conduct various research tasks and have a discussion during a session that will last until our document is finalized.

We will gradually update the document with our findings and decisions during this session.

Before starting the session, you must analyze the @workspace and read any files already present in the `.devspecs/` directory.

You must ask me clarifying questions as needed, and use any tools available for research as needed. But do NOT use any of these tools right now. We're just setting the rules for this session.

You must ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough Technology Brief document for this project in the end. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed document that can be used by developers, AI agents, architects, and any other team members to understand the technical foundations, frameworks, libraries, development tools, and technical constraints of the project.

Let's create this document iteratively through an interview, and dig into every relevant technical detail to compose the document. Remember, ask me only one question at a time.

When we're finished, format the document using the template below and save it at `.devspecs/memory/tech.md`. Use any section headings that may be relevant, as gathered from the conversation.

Here's the template:

```md
---
applyTo: "**/*"

# Technology Brief: [PRODUCT NAME]

```

Now let's start.

Confirm that you understood, before we begin with your first question.
