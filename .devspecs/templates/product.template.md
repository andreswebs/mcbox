## Overview

%

Provide a high-level overview of the product here.

Explain in one or two paragraphs why the product exists and the problems it solves (the Proble), who it's for (the Personas), and how it should work for its users (the Vision and the Goals).

## Development Roadmap

Break down the development process into phases:

- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks

%

## Logical Dependency Chain

%

Define the logical order of development:

- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible, front-end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches

%

# Risks and Mitigations

%

Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:

- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that can be built upon
- Resource constraints

%

# Appendix
